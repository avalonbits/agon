AGON assemmbly programs.
========================

A few programs written in eZ80 assembly for the Agon Light running MOS 1.02 (or later?).

All programs were assembled using SPASM-ng which works on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

Each program has its own directory with a Makefile to assemble it. Once assembled, copy the resulting .bin file to your Agon's microsd card.
To run the program, at the MOS prompt type:

```
*load program.bin
*run
```
