SNES controller mapper
======================

If you connect an SNES controller to your AGON over I2C, using the MOD-WII-UEXT from Olimex,
this program will show the button presses from your controller.

If you would like to test it yourself, you will need:
1. An SNES controller (any one you find on Amazon should work)
1. A [Hyperkin snes -> wii adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Adapter-Classic-super-nintendo/dp/B075RMYMNH) that costs $10,00
1. An [MOD-WII-UEXT](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Sensors/MOD-WII/MOD-WII-UEXT/open-source-hardware) from Olimex.

Once in the program, pressing the buttons will change their colors on screen.

Pressing `START+SELECT` together exits the program.
