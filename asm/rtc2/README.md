MOD-RTC2-UEXT get time.
=======================

Reads the current time from the [MOD-RTC2-UEXT](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Time/MOD-RTC2/open-source-hardware)
expansion module, using the I2C api available on MOS 1.04+

This requires real hardware and won't work on the emulator.
The MOD-RTC2-UEXT is compatible only with the AgonLight by olimex.

You can, if you'd like, wire it directly to the I2C pines of your Agon Origins or Console8
